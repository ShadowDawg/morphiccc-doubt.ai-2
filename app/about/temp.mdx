## - WTF is `Doubt.ai`?
```  
A chat-bot designed to help you solve your JEE Adv and NEET doubts. You just type in your doubt/question and you get its solution along with its sources, relevant picutures and follow-up questions.
## - Why should I use this instead of Google?
```  

On googling a question you aren't promptly provided with a solution, but rather a myriad links to various websites like toppr or brainly where it is not uncommon to find poorly explained solutions which may even turn out to be incorrect. And if you're a particularly ambitious student, you might even have come across a question which doesn't seem to have a solution online. These were inconvenieces which we ourselves faced when we were preparing for competitive exams. With doubt.ai we have attempted to offer an alternative which smoothens one's learning experience by taking care of these things, providing you with a (mostly) accurate solution  along with reputable sources, images and follow-up questions designed to deepen your understanding. Using doubt.ai also empowers the user to ask questions regarding a particular part of the solution, making sure that no concept is left ignored.
## - How do I know that `doubt.ai`'s solution is correct?
~~Trust us, we're from IITM and we cleared JEE Advanced~~
Accuracy is our top-most priority. If our answers and explanation aren't right, there is no reason for `doubt.ai` to exist. All this being said, we have had a great response from our early testers with regards to accuracy. But we must admit that the current beta version still makes mistakes! (albeit, rarely). It does tend to have trouble solving completely new and original questions which have no trace of a solution online. And its techinal knowledge is currently limited to fairly well documented concepts/theories. Despite these limitations it still excels JEE Mains and NEET level questions, which is what most of our target demographic is preparing for. Anyways, we are committed to accuracy and it will only get better.

## - Who are the awesome people who made this?
Doubt.ai was developed by an amazing group of first-year students at IIT Madras. But since I put in the most effort and I'm a slave to my ego, I am only gonna attach a huge flattering picture of myself and take all the credit :)

## First Release

The first beta version of `doubt.ai` was released to the students of IIT Madras 2 days ago, on the night of 4th April, 2024. Here are some of the highlights:
1. The response has been overwhelming to the point that our site was down for almost 20 minutes that night due to the magnitude of user activity.
2. we have recieved great feedback, almost all in our favour. Users reported that its accuracy is "miles better than chatgpt and copilot".
3. A student reached out saying that it even solved questions which he himself had prepared as part of a JEE mock paper, getting all answers right and even providing excellent explanations. It aces JEE/NEET pyq's and presents the solution in a "very pleasing format".
4. It seems to do exceptionally well in Physics and people even started using it to solve our college's physics homework which it surprisingly got almost completely right. A friend even suggested that it would have performed better than me in our last Physics quiz ~~which kinda hurt my feelings 😞~~

We also shot a demo video in my hostel room. Check it out here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYZTLIEvpi4

We aren't gonna stop here. `doubt.ai` is gonna provide the best learning experience. Its gonna become more accurate and its explanations are gonna be better than any teacher. Its only a matter of time.
You can contribute to realising this vision by giving us your valuable feedback.
